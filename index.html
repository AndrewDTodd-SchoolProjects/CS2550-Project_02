Project: Project 2 (About Me CSS)
Name: Andrew Todd

I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection:   My initial About Me page was already styled with CSS exept for one embeded style tag in the index.html, so this required no changes to the html other than that. The added styles were fairly simple to implement, but also pretty tedeous

                <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        
                <p>I am a game developer. I am interested in pretty much all aspects of the game development process. I am particularly interested/involved in game systems engineering. I also have an interest in 3D Modeling though.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy telling stories. This overlaps with my love of game development, as I believe it is the best medium for storytelling. Other than games though I am also a writer. I would like to extend some of my book narratives into the realm of video games.</p>
                <p>When I am not involved in creating worlds either in text or on the screen I like to enjoy the ones others have built. I have a love for old movies and tv (like the golden age of hollywood). I think the vast majority of the excessive quantity of media coming out today is either terrible, or is just not really good enough to consume even though it may not be totally trash.</p>
